<!-- PROJECT 1  -->
## 1_Speed_dating
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>We will start a new data visualization and exploration project. Your goal will be to try to understand love! It's a very complicated subject so we've simplified it. Your goal is going to be to understand what happens during a speed dating and especially to understand what will influence the obtaining of a second date.
>
>This is a Kaggle competition on which you can find more details here : [Speed Dating Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment#Speed%20Dating%20Data%20Key.doc)
</p>
<br>
<u>French Topic related regarding the certification:</u>
<br>

>Bloc n°2 - Analyse exploratoire, descriptive et inférentielle de données
<br><br>

<!-- PROJECT 2  -->
## 2_Booking
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.
>
>In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.
>
>Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:
>
> - Weather
> - Hotels in the area
>The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.
</p>

<u>French Topic related regarding the certification:</u>
<br>

>Bloc n°1 - Construction et alimentation d'une infrastructure de gestion de données
<br><br>


<!-- PROJECT 3  -->
## 3_Walmart
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.
>
>Goals of the project can be divided into three steps:
> - Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
> - Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
> - Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model
</p>
<br>
<u>French Topic related regarding the certification:</u>
<br>

>Bloc n°3 - Analyse prédictive de données structurées par l'intelligence artificielle
<br><br>


<!-- PROJECT 3b  -->
## 3b_Conversion_rate
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.
>
>They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

<br><br>

<!-- PROJECT 4  -->
## 4_Uber_pickups
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.
>
>(If you are not familiar with the bay area, check out Google Maps)
>
>Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.
>
>Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.

<br><br>


## 5_Disaster_tweets
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>[Check the Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
</p>
<br>
<u>French Topic related regarding the certification:</u>
<br>

>Bloc n°5 - Industrialisation d'un algorithme d'apprentissage automatique et automatisation des processus de décision
<br><br>

## 6_Wine_o_meter
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>The data-science team has worked together on creating the best model predicting the quality score (from 0 to 10) of multiple wines. The next step is to include this model into the mobile application. The development team is expecting an API endpoint in order to request the model and display the result inside the application.
>
>Your job is to put the trained model into production. Hopefully, the team provided you their work:
> - a model.joblib which is the trained model pickled (saved using joblib library),
> - the notebook used to train the model (Model_Training.ipynb) and the dataset (winequality.csv), so you can have a look,
> - a test notebook (Test_Endpoint.ipynb) so you can assert that your endpoint is meeting the requirements.

## 7_Holi.io
<br>

<u>What is asked?</u>
<p>

>This project is the final project as a Jedha Students. 
>Idea has been submitted by Holi.io Founder : Clément Sirvente
>The specifications from Holi.io can be found [here](https://github.com/FlorianG-dev/Jedha_certification/blob/master/7_Holi/Project_initialization.pdf). It is the projet number 1 : Topic modeling

<u>Precisions for the readers:</u>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>You can begin with the project specifications, we are the project number 1 <a href="https://github.com/FlorianG-dev/Jedha_certification/blob/master/7_Holi/Project_initialization.pdf">here</a></li>
  <li>Then look at the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4U8ha9odjo&t=1321s&ab_channel=JedhaBootcamp">our presentation</a> (if you understand French) , we are using <a href="https://github.com/FlorianG-dev/Jedha_certification/blob/master/7_Holi/Project_final_presentation.pdf">this powerpoint</a></li>
  <li>After that you can visit our <a href="https://jedha-holi-text-analyzer.herokuapp.com/">WebApp</a>, be careful as it is hosting on Heroku free, only one person can visit at a time</li>
  <li>Finally you can go deep in the code, beginning with the notebook <a href="https://github.com/FlorianG-dev/Jedha_certification/blob/master/7_Holi/Step1_import_data.ipynb">Step1</a> and then the <a href="https://github.com/FlorianG-dev/Jedha_certification/blob/master/7_Holi/Step2_LDA_model_training.ipynb">Step2</a>. You can end by looking at our App code.
